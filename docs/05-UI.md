## Gutenberg blocks

See `{theme}/app/Blocks/contract-picker.php` and 
`{theme}/app/Blocks/contract-picker-b2b.php` for constructing blocks with
data and template.

See `{theme}/app/resources/blocks/contract-picker.blade.php` and 
`{theme}/app/resources/blocks/contract-picker-b2b.blade.php` for constructing
component with default data.

## Components

## Steps

### B2B

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** `toggleStepsB2B` function has hard coded
values for consumption limits.

## SOPA link

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** `cleanParamsForSopaLink` function has hard coded
values for generating special campaign additional product.

## Postcode check

Postcode check will call `/{wp-json}/electro/v1/company` REST API endpoint with
`postcode` parameter. Logic for the endpoint is in `src/Http/Rest/CompanyController.php`
file.

Postcode data is in `resources/companies.csv` and it's used in 
`src/Company/CompanyRepository.php` which can return the correct SOPA 
link's base URL for given postcode. By editing the CSV directly it is possible
to add or remove postcodes.
